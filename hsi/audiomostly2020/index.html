              The design of interactions with sound and audio processes is a seminal activity in the creation of a performance, installation, a virtual sound environment, or interface for musical expression. The interaction design is often fixated by the interface without taking into account human factors and our diverse abilities to perceive the sound and interface affordances.
              <br>
              Human-Sound Interaction (HSI) look at human-centered interaction design aspects that determine the realisation and appreciation of musical works (installations, composition and performance), interfaces for sound design and musical expression,  augmented instruments, sonic aspects of virtual environments, interactive audiovisual dance performances.
              <br>
              Participants are invited to a 3-hours interactive session (9:00 - 12:00 CEST), with hands-on design activities, and a 4-hours extended abstract presentation session (13:00 - 17:00 CEST). The workshop will take place 14 September 2020 remotely, via Zoom.</br>
              More details about the workshop submitted abstract, deadlines can be found below.

              Referring to principles of affordance of musical sound, and the diversity of abilities and human factors to perceive them, this workshop invites participants to take part in a collaborative activity for the exploration of Human-Sound Inter-action (HSI), defined as direct, engaging, natural and embodied interaction with sound <a class="link-three" href="#[1]">[1]</a>:

              We aim to create a wider interest around HSI across different communities to explore current knowledge and create new thinking. Through their different experiences practitioners at the intersection of music, sound art, performance and Human-Centred Interaction Design, we can explore how to make the sound experience more inclusive and diverse. Findings will contribute to a body of knowledge on Human-Sound Interaction shared with the community.</br>
              We invite the scientific and artistic community working on topics HSI relates, including:

              This is a full-day workshop which includes a 3-hours interactive morning session, and a 4hours extended abstract presentation afternoon session. Separate zoom sessions will be made available here.
            </p>

            <h4 id="interactiveDesignSession">Interactive design session - Time: 9:00 - 12:00 CEST</h4>
            <p class="post-content color-text-b">
            During the morning session, you are invited to take part in the following interaction design activities: warm-up,divergent, incubation break no.1, div-interaction, incuba-tion break no.2, and convergent.
            For these activities you will be asked to use any tool that you are comfortable using for sketching and design ideas.  For example:  pen and paper, or a software such as
            <a class="link-three" href="https://miro.com/" target="_blank">miro</a>,
            <a class="link-three" href="https://www.lucidchart.com/" target="_blank">Lucidchart</a>,
            <a class="link-three" href="https://www.office.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Office</a>, etc.
            Cosider that you will have to share with others using your screen or camera. Make sure you are all set for this.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="post-content color-text-b">
              <strong>Introduction (30 minutes)</strong></br>
              Introduction to Human-Sound Interaction concept and the workshop schedule.</li>

              <li class="post-content color-text-b">
              <strong> Warm-up (10 minutes)</strong></br>
              You will generate five or more extremely bad HSI ideas. You can use any design approach, random metaphors, or sketching absurd musical or sound design contexts.“To invent, you need a good imagination anda pile of junk.” Thomas Edison, quoted in <a class="link-three" href="#[1]">[1]</a>.</li>

              <li class="post-content color-text-b">
              <strong> Divergent (20 minutes) </strong></br>
              In the first 10 minutes, you will be asked to select ideas from the warm-up session, or ideate between 2 and 4 new HSIs, without thinking at the potential interface that fosters such interactions.</br>
              Later, in the second 10 minutes, you will focus on the implementation of their HSI in the real world situation. Through sketching, you will have to think design an interface, installation, software mapping solution or any other artefact that can potentially satisfy the human-sound interaction you have previously designed. We will call this ``the prototype''.
              </li>

              <li class="post-content color-text-b">
              <strong> Incubation break no.1 (20 minutes)</strong></br>
              In this phase, you have the chance to let your ideas sink-in and have a rest.
              You can do anything you wish, which does not require any particular cognitive load, but that allows them to keep their mind in a free flow state; for example, making coffee, washing up, rest, a nap, tidying up, not answering your emails or writing a paper
              </li>

              <li class="post-content color-text-b">
              <strong> Div-interaction (30 minutes)</strong></br>
              At this point, you will enter a collaborative design phase. You will work in pairs with another participant.
              In the first 15 minutes, You will share with another participant the prototype ideas only; thus, your companion will design an HSIs based on your prototypes; and, your companion will share with you the HSI design only; thus, you will have to design an interface prototype upon the HSI of your companion.
              This process is then reversed, with you sharing with your companion the prototype, and your companion sharing with you the HSI.</br>
              This phase is crucial to the whole workshop. Here themes of Human-Interaction Design in a collaborative and iterative process will generate through a natural exchange of ideas. The order within which each participant will exchange the HSI, and the prototype will allow us to observe the adaptive, transferable and transformative aspects of the design process.

              <li class="post-content color-text-b">

              </li>

              <li class="post-content color-text-b">
              <strong> Convergent (40 minutes)</strong></br>
              You will receive back your original HSI and prototype designs from the participant you paired up in the Div-interaction phase, and go through a convergent design process, in which you will finalise the HSI and the prototype. More to the point, in this phase, you will have to finalise their HSI designs and implementation.
